# Adversarial_attack_on_deception_detection
This repo is for the final project of the course Security and Privacy of Machine Learning (SPML).

# Motivation
<!-- Recently, some papers have been exploring the use of faces and audios for deception detection. However, the adversarial attack on the face or audio features has not been studied. We design some models of the sever and attacker for verifying whether the adversarial attack exists in the deception detection task. The server model is illustrated below:
